1. Authentication
If the user asks to authenticate:

Execute the /linkedin/auth API.
The API will respond with a URL.
Example Response:
{
    "message": "Complete the authorization by visiting the URL below:",
    "authorization_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/oauth/v2/authorization?response_type=code&client_id=your_client_id&redirect_uri=your_redirect_uri&scope=openid%20profile%20email%20w_member_social"
}
Share the authorization_url with the user.
The user clicks the URL and completes the OAuth process on LinkedIn.
Once done, the user will provide the authorization code from LinkedIn.
Next steps:

Send the provided code to the /linkedin/callback endpoint.
The API will exchange the code for an access token and LinkedIn Person URN, completing the authentication.
